                <p>JonBenét Patricia Ramsey was murdered. That is the only certain thing about this case after 26 years. There is key evidence in this case as well as more theories than there are people involved.</p>
                
                <p>On December 26, 1996, the body of six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey was discovered in the basement of her family's home in Boulder, Colorado. Her death was ruled a homicide, with the cause determined to be strangulation by a garrote and a skull fracture.</p>
                
                <p>The case began when JonBenét's mother, Patsy Ramsey, called 911 early that morning to report that her daughter was missing and that she had found a ransom note demanding $118,000 for her return. Hours later, JonBenét's father, John Ramsey, discovered her body in the basement.</p>
                
                <p>The investigation was immediately complicated by several factors. The crime scene was contaminated by friends and family who had been invited over after the 911 call. The Boulder Police Department, which had little experience with homicide investigations, made critical errors in securing and processing the scene.</p>
                
                <p>The ransom note itself became a key piece of evidence. It was unusually long for a ransom note, written on paper from a pad found in the Ramsey home, and demanded a sum that was close to John Ramsey's recent bonus. Handwriting experts have been divided on whether Patsy Ramsey could have written it.</p>
                
                <p>DNA evidence found on JonBenét's clothing did not match any family members, but it was too degraded for a complete profile. In 2008, new DNA testing techniques identified male DNA on her clothing that also did not match anyone in the Ramsey family, leading the District Attorney to formally exonerate the Ramseys.</p>
                
                <p>Over the years, numerous theories have emerged about who killed JonBenét. Some investigators believed one or both parents were involved, possibly covering up an accidental death. Others pointed to JonBenét's brother Burke, who was nine at the time. Still others believed an intruder committed the crime.</p>
                
                <p>Despite one of the most extensive investigations in Colorado history, with over 1,400 pieces of evidence collected and more than 750 people interviewed, the case remains unsolved. The Boulder Police Department continues to investigate, but leads have dwindled over time.</p>
                
                <p>The case captured national attention not only for its brutality but also because of JonBenét's participation in child beauty pageants, with many media outlets publishing glamorized photos of the young girl. The case also raised questions about the influence of wealth and connections on criminal investigations.</p>
                
                <p>In this episode, we explore the facts of the case, the evidence that has been made public, and the various theories that have emerged over the decades. Join us as we delve into one of America's most infamous unsolved murders.</p>
